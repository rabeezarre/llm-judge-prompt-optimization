    "*Improvement*: Refine the judge's understanding of what constitutes a direct command. Emphasize that a direct command must explicitly instruct the user to perform a specific action, not just provide information or ask a question.",
    "**Underclassification of Suggestions**:",
    "The judge often fails to recognize suggestions, classifying them as 'No Instruction' (4% of errors). This indicates the judge may not fully grasp the nuances of indirect recommendations.",
    "*Improvement*: Provide clearer examples of suggestions in the training data and instructions. Highlight that suggestions can be subtle and may use phrases like \"you might want to consider\" or \"it could be helpful to.\"",
    "**Misinterpretation of Tone and Wording**:",
    "The judge struggles with the tone and wording of messages, often misclassifying them. For instance, it may interpret informative messages as commands or vice versa.",
    "*Improvement*: Train the judge to better understand the tone of messages. Provide examples of different tones (direct, suggestive, informative) and how they relate to the output options.",
    "**Over-reliance on Keywords**:",
    "The judge may be over-relying on specific keywords to make its classification, leading to misclassifications when these keywords are present or absent in nuanced ways.",
    "*Improvement*: Encourage the judge to consider the overall context and structure of the message, not just individual words. Provide examples of messages with similar keywords but different classifications.",
    "**Lack of Contextual Understanding**:",
    "The judge may not fully understand the context in which a message is given, leading to misclassifications. For example, it may not recognize that a message is a response to a user's request and thus not a direct command.",
    "*Improvement*: Train the judge to consider the broader context of the conversation. Provide examples of messages within their conversational context and explain how the context influences the classification.",
    "**Ambiguity in Instructions**:",
    "The current instructions may be ambiguous or too broad, leading to inconsistent classifications. For example, the term \"direct\" could be interpreted in different ways.",
    "*Improvement*: Provide more precise definitions and examples for each output option. Use clear, unambiguous language in the instructions.",
    "**Insufficient Training Data**:",
    "The judge may not have been trained on a diverse enough set of examples, leading to poor generalization to new cases.",
    "*Improvement*: Expand the training data to include a wider variety of messages and contexts. Ensure the training data is balanced across the different output options.",
