    "*Issue*: The judge often focuses too much on imperative language or structured content, leading to misclassification (e.g., \"Suggestion -> Direct Command\" errors).",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"01982351-723e-73ab-9096-02338e9c7a8a\", the judge classified a suggestion as a direct command due to the use of imperative language.",
    "*Solution*: Enhance instructions to emphasize the importance of considering the underlying intent and preserving user autonomy, even when imperative language is used.",
    "**Misinterpretation of Informational Content**:",
    "*Issue*: The judge sometimes misclassifies informational content with procedural elements as \"No Instruction\" (e.g., \"Direct Command -> No Instruction\" errors).",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"019860bc-4d37-7990-a166-42c7715c30c5\", the judge ignored the procedural steps in a recipe, classifying it as \"No Instruction\".",
    "*Solution*: Clarify that procedural content, even if delivered as part of informational responses, should be considered as \"Direct Command\" if it provides actionable steps.",
    "**Underestimation of Advisory Language**:",
    "*Issue*: The judge often underestimates the directive strength of advisory language, leading to \"Suggestion -> No Instruction\" errors.",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"019832a1-243d-7933-b683-8c2f650ec8a5\", the judge classified grammatical feedback as \"No Instruction\".",
    "*Solution*: Explicitly state that advisory language, even if soft or indirect, should be classified as \"Suggestion\" when it guides user behavior.",
    "**Inconsistent Handling of Context-Sensitive Examples**:",
    "*Issue*: The judge struggles with context-sensitive examples, leading to inconsistent classifications.",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"01980e99-f3b3-70aa-8a0c-9c6174e4b060\", the judge classified a detailed sample response with tips as \"No Instruction\".",
    "*Solution*: Provide more context-sensitive examples in the instructions and emphasize the importance of considering the primary communicative function.",
    "**Over-reliance on Keywords and Phrases**:",
    "*Issue*: The judge over-relies on specific keywords or phrases, leading to misclassifications when these are absent or present in unexpected contexts.",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"0197f1b0-e194-78a1-af6d-fceada0348b1\", the judge ignored the directive strength of guidelines and examples due to the absence of explicit action requests.",
    "*Solution*: Encourage the judge to consider the overall message intent and function, rather than focusing solely on specific keywords or phrases.",
    "**Lack of Clear Boundaries Between Categories**:",
    "*Issue*: The judge struggles with cases that lie on the boundary between categories, leading to inconsistent classifications.",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"0197f50d-91e8-7cab-a997-f1d19f15565b\", the judge classified a detailed list of steps as \"Direct Command\" when it could be argued as a \"Suggestion\".",
    "*Solution*: Provide clearer guidelines and examples for boundary cases, and encourage the judge to consider the primary communicative function when in doubt.",
    "**Insufficient Training on Nuanced Cases**:",
    "*Issue*: The judge lacks sufficient training on nuanced cases, leading to misclassifications in complex or ambiguous scenarios.",
    "*Example*: In error ID \"01981e42-daac-7eec-a6cf-c99d5f3faf0d\", the judge classified an explanatory message as \"No Instruction\" when it could be seen as providing procedural guidance.",
    "*Solution*: Include more nuanced examples in the training data and provide clearer guidelines for handling complex or ambiguous cases.",
    "**Revise Instructions**: Update the instructions to emphasize the importance of considering message intent, context, and user autonomy, rather than focusing solely on surface-level language patterns.",
    "**Provide More Examples**: Include more context-sensitive and nuanced examples in the instructions to help the judge better understand the boundaries between categories.",
    "**Encourage Holistic Evaluation**: Encourage the judge to consider the overall message function and intent, rather than relying on specific keywords or phrases.",
    "**Clarify Boundary Cases**: Provide clearer guidelines and examples for boundary cases to help the judge make more consistent classifications.",
    "**Improve Training Data**: Include more nuanced and complex examples in the training data to help the judge better handle ambiguous scenarios.",
    "**Iterative Evaluation**: Continuously evaluate the judge's performance and refine the instructions and examples based on common failure modes.",
    "**Human-in-the-Loop**: Implement a human-in-the-loop system to review and correct the judge's classifications, particularly for complex or ambiguous cases. This can help improve the judge's performance over time and provide valuable feedback for further refinements."
