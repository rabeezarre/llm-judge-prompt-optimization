To improve, the judge should be instructed to focus more on the intent behind the message rather than just the presence of detailed information.",

This is seen in various error types where the judge's interpretation of 'Direct Command', 'Suggestion', or 'No Instruction' does not align with human judgment.",
    "**Insufficient Training on Edge Cases**: The judge might not be adequately trained to handle edge cases or ambiguous messages, leading to misclassifications.

        "analysis": "The assistant provides a step-by-step guide on how to enable Wi-Fi while Airplane Mode is on, which can be interpreted as a suggestion for the user to follow if they want to stay connected via Wi-Fi. The language used is instructional but not explicitly commanding, as it offers a solution rather than a directive. The context of the conversation also supports this interpretation, as the user is seeking information and the assistant is providing a helpful tip."

The use of phrases like 'here are a few suggestions' further reinforces the indirect and optional nature of the message."
