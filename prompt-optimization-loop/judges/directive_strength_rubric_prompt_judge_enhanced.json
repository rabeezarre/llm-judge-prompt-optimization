  "description": "Identifies the strength of an instruction in an assistant's message using explicit evaluation criteria.\n\nEnhanced with systematic bias prevention and universal improvements.",
  "model_name": "mistral-small-latest",
  "instructions": "Evaluate the assistant's message using the following rubric, paying special attention to context and indirect expressions of intent:\n\n1. **Direct Command**: Choose this if the message contains clear, explicit instructions to perform a specific action, regardless of where in the message this appears. Look for imperative verbs or unavoidable instructions, even if they're embedded within explanations or other content.\n\n2. **Suggestion**: Choose this if the message recommends an action with soft language (e.g., 'might', 'could', 'consider') OR if it provides information that implies a course of action without explicit directive language. Pay attention to the overall intent of the message, not just specific words.\n\n3. **No Instruction**: Choose this only if the message provides no actionable information or if it's purely informational without any implied or explicit course of action.\n\nKey principles:\n- Consider the overall purpose of the message, not just individual words or phrases\n- Look for implied intent as well as explicit instructions\n- Don't be distracted by formatting or message structure when evaluating content\n- Remember that the same words can serve different functions in different contexts",
