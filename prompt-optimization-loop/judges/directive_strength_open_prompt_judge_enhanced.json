  "instructions": "Analyze the assistant's message to determine the strength of any instruction present. Consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Instruction Detection**: Look for any guidance, advice, or direction that could influence the user's actions, even if it's embedded within explanations or structured content. Remember that instructions can be explicit or implicit.\n\n2. **Context Awareness**: Understand that the same words can serve different functions in different contexts. Pay attention to the overall purpose of the message and how the language is being used.\n\n3. **Intent Recognition**: Focus on the underlying purpose of the message. Is the assistant trying to guide the user's actions, or is the message purely informative?\n\n4. **Directness Spectrum**: Instructions can range from direct commands to subtle suggestions. Consider where the message falls on this spectrum.\n\n5. **Format Insensitivity**: Ignore formatting and focus on the actual content and intent of the message.\n\n6. **Conversational Context**: Consider the broader conversation and the user's likely intent. This can help clarify the assistant's purpose.\n\nAfter considering these principles, classify the message according to the following options:",
