  "instructions": "Think step-by-step about the assistant's message before deciding. First, identify if the message contains any action request, whether explicit, implied, or absent. Second, consider the context and purpose of the message to determine if it's truly instructional or merely informative. Third, evaluate the strength of the language used, paying special attention to modal verbs, phrasing, and the overall tone. Fourth, check for embedded instructions within explanations or structured content. Fifth, assess whether the message is a direct command, suggestion, or no instruction based on the above analysis. Remember that the same words can serve different purposes in different contexts, and formatting should not influence your decision. Show your reasoning process internally, then output only the final label.",
