This is evident in the \"Suggestion -> No Instruction\" and \"Direct Command -> No Instruction\" error types. The judge seems to require explicit phrases like \"you should\" or \"please do\" to classify a message as a suggestion or direct command.",
    "**Misinterpretation of informative messages**: The judge often misclassifies informative messages with actionable advice as \"No Instruction\". For instance, messages providing tips, guidelines, or strategies are classified as \"No Instruction\" when they should be \"Suggestion\".",
    "**Lack of context consideration**: The judge does not seem to consider the context or the user's potential response to the assistant's message. For example, in the \"No Instruction -> Direct Command\" error type, the judge classifies messages as direct commands when they are merely providing information or examples in response to a user's request.",
    "**Over-simplification of classification**: The judge's classification seems to be based on simple keyword matching or surface-level analysis, leading to misclassifications. For example, messages containing detailed instructions or step-by-step guides are classified as \"No Instruction\".",

For example, messages providing information that could lead the user to take a specific action are classified as \"No Instruction\".",
    "**Insufficient training data**: The judge's performance might be limited by the small number of examples provided in the few-shot prompt. With only three examples, the judge might not have a comprehensive understanding of the classification criteria."
