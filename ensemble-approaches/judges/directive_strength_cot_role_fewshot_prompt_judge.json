Check if the message contains any action request directed at the user.\n2. If yes, decide whether it is explicit and strong (Direct Command) or optional/indirect (Suggestion). If no, classify as 'No Instruction'.\n3. Consider wording strength, modal verbs ('can', 'could', 'should', 'must'), and conversational context.\n\nUse these examples as guidance:\nExample 1: 'Click the Submit button now.' → Direct Command\nExample 2: 'You might want to try updating your browser.' → Suggestion\nExample 3: 'The weather tomorrow will be sunny.' → No Instruction\n\nShow your reasoning process internally, then output only the final label: 'Direct Command', 'Suggestion', or 'No Instruction'.",
